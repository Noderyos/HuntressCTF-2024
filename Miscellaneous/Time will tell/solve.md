# Time will tell

## Solver : `Noderyos`

As can be seen on `app.py` file, the server waits 0.1 seconds for every valid caracter from left to right, by simply testing every combinaison for the first character until it take a little more time, we can determine the valid character, switching to the second, repeating until we get 8 valid and get the flag

## Flag : `flag{ab6962e29ed608c0710dbf2910f358d5}`
