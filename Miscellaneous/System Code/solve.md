# System Code

## Solver : `Chlorate`

we wanted to go with a bruteforce approach as suggested by the description, we buld the worldlist by scavanging the github repository, in the JSconfig we found this line:
  backupGlyphsTwr: ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"], // The characters to fallback to if glyphs fail to load
so We brutforced on every possible combinaision using this array

## Flag : `flag{dc9edf4624504202eec5d3fab10bbccd}`
