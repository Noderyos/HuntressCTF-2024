# Echo Chamber 

# Solver : `Noderyos`

### To reduce repo size, I compressed the input file

The file contains ICMP exchange, after extracting ICMP data with `tshark` I saw that every packet have the same byte repeated, by keeping only one, and concatenating all bytes, we got a PNG containg the flag, but when flaging, I just saw the flag in PNG strings

Script in `main.py`

# Flag : `flag{6b38aa917a754d8bf384dc73fde633ad}`
