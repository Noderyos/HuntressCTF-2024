# Stack It

## Solver : `Noderyos`

Idk exactly what the file does at end, but it starts by XORing 2 strings, that gives me the flag ... so ....

Here is the python script
```py
a = b"1ecff8bece9486287dc76521a84bb7c0"
b = [0x53,0x51,0x51,0x55,0x52,0x5e,0x56,0x07,0x01,0x04,0x0d,0x02,0x00,0x03,0x56,0x5b,0x0f,0x50,0x07,0x01,0x53,0x50,0x0b,0x50,0x55,0x00,0x51,0x5b,0x01,0x06,0x53,0x06]
print(bytes(a[i]^b[i] for i in range(32)))
```

## Flag : `flag{b4234f4bba4685dc84d6ee9a48e9c106}`
